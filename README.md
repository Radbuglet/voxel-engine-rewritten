# Voxellent

An engine-agnostic library for handling cubic voxel worlds.

Voxellent provides data structures for creating and interacting with infinitely sized cubic worlds and generating optimized meshes to render them. Voxellent makes no assumptions about the underlying rendering technology and the world voxel data structures are completely decoupled from the meshing subsystem.
